An outstanding work of 14th-century aristocratic ecclesiastical architecture, the Evangelical Church of Szászrégen, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was built by patron Tamás Losonczi for the city’s Saxon community. Nestled in a picturesque setting, the church is the city’s oldest and most valuable building, commonly referred to simply as the “Saxon Church.” A Latin inscription in capital letters carved into the stone on the northern wall informs us about its construction—this is the oldest inscription in medieval Transylvania. Dated to 1330, it names Master Tamás as the patron and also mentions a priest named Miklós.

Structurally, the church follows the three-nave, columned, basilica-style layout typical of 13th-century Saxon churches, featuring a polygonal main sanctuary and a western tower projecting into the main nave in Gothic style. The square-shaped western tower juts into the nave similarly to many Romanesque churches. The most beautiful feature of the western façade is the monumental, slightly protruding main portal, crowned by a pointed triangular pediment. A spiral staircase located in the southwest corner of the nave leads up to the western gallery, where the region's largest organ is found—built in 1849 by organ builder Carl Schneider of Brașov.

The main nave of the Saxon Church is covered with a Baroque dome vault decorated with stucco cartouches. The interesting arrangement of the western tower projecting into the nave and the gallery reflects a remarkable example of Saxon tower placement and family monasteries. The straight-ended side aisles flank the polygonal sanctuary, which opens into the main nave through a triumphal arch. The monumental main altar and the larger-than-life statue of Christ were created between 1857 and 1858, along with the elegant pulpit attached to the triumphal arch. Its crown features gilded evangelist figures, added in 1871.

The basilica-style church remained in its original form until the fire caused by the Rákóczi War of Independence in 1708. At that time, the main and side aisles and the towers suffered severe damage. During the reconstruction in 1787, modifications were made that altered parts of the original style. The church also fell victim to further fires, including the great fire of 1848, which again caused extensive damage. Its current form was achieved during the restoration led by Gustav Müller between 1927 and 1930.

Among the art-historically valuable elements of the church are an early Gothic window with reliefs of human heads—possibly depicting patron Tamás Bánffy and his wife—and a simple carved stone sedilia in the sanctuary. Other notable features include the sacrament niche built into the sanctuary wall, the coat of arms above the sacristy door, and two figurative keystones in the eastern vault section—one bearing the Losonci Bánffy coat of arms, the other depicting the Lamb of God. A reverse cone-shaped console decorated with a beautiful vine motif, found at the base of the spiral staircase leading to the tower, also stands out as a unique architectural detail.

Among the valuable parts of the church is the Chapel of Saint Lawrence, along with the child-sized torso on its exterior wall, which likely represents Saint Lawrence himself. It is said that the chapel originally stood on Saint Lawrence Hill or perhaps on the Bodogály Ridge before being attached to the church in 1630. The chapel played an important role in the lives of the local people as a pilgrimage site. Moreover, the torso in the chapel’s western corner is believed to date from when it was still a separate building, as Lutherans no longer created statues. The chapel’s Gothic vault was lost in the fire of 1848, but the two-section Gothic ribbed vault of the sanctuary has survived.

According to a legend, the builder of the chapel believed that after its completion, he would still have enough money to live comfortably for the rest of his life. But by the time the work was completed, he was left with only enough money for an egg. In his grief, he ate the egg and died.

Another legend related to the church, told by carpenter Márton Wolff, speaks of a stone-carved grape cluster located on the lower keystone of the spiral staircase leading to the tower. According to the story, in 1848, a Franciscan friar named Veress from Mikháza claimed to have found a document in the monastery archive proving that a great treasure was hidden under this stone grape cluster. It was supposedly placed there by the church’s builder to be used in case the church ever burned down or became too small, so a new one could be built. Unfortunately, the treasure has never been found—though it would have been much needed after the fire of 1848. Today, the church is a symbol of the city and a part of the Saxon heritage, frequently visited by students and teachers.
