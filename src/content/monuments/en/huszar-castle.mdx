In Abafája, which was annexed to the city in 1956, lies the Huszár family mansion, of which today only the bare walls remain. However, the mansion has a very rich historical past—if its walls could speak, they would have many stories to tell. Built in a neoclassical style, the mansion was at one time owned by Pál Gyulay of Abafája, princely secretary and advisor. Many notable figures visited the mansion, including Kelemen Mikes. In 1901, Archduke Charles of Habsburg stayed here as a guest. Albert Wass and János Kemény also visited several times, and the poet Jenő Dsida served as a tutor in the mansion. In 1912, Baron József Húszár of Kövesd, a participant in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence, was born here.

There is no exact data on the year the mansion was built. One part of the building still preserves its coffered wooden ceiling, a reminder of the mansion's former opulence. According to historical records, the mansion was richly and tastefully furnished. Its interiors were decorated with furniture in German Renaissance, Baroque, and Neoclassical styles, as well as valuable folk art objects and paintings. The mansion had 32 rooms. Upstairs were the library, the grand salon, the chapel, the dining room, and guest rooms. On the ground floor were the rooms of family members and tutors, as well as the quarters of the butler's family. The mansion also featured a beautiful 30-acre English-style park, with three fishponds that had swans and small islets. Additionally, the park included an artificial cave, a fountain, and statues.

The fate of the mansion was sealed by nationalization. It housed an institution for a time, but was eventually abandoned and has stood empty for a very long time. The building has fallen prey to time, its condition deteriorating day by day until it eventually disappears completely. The mansion is a sad example of the consequences of human neglect and carelessness.
