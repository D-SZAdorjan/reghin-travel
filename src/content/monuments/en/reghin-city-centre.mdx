The historical appearance of Szászrégen was similar to that of other medieval Transylvanian towns. Its buildings were made of wood and adobe, with thatched roofs, while only important buildings were constructed from stone—and there were very few of those. The streets were narrow, winding, and dirty. During the great fire of 1848, three-quarters of the town burned down. After that, the beautiful neo-Baroque, neoclassical, and Art Nouveau buildings—considered modern for their time—were constructed and are still visible today.

Vilmos Hankó, in his 1896 work *Székelyföld*, described the town as follows: “Szászrégen is a small town with about six thousand inhabitants on the right bank of the Mureș River. Its leafy trees and orchards surround a uniquely beautiful, large marketplace, lined with massive houses and palaces. Its city-style restaurants, nicely paved streets, and splendid promenade pleasantly surprise the passing traveler.”

In the mid-20th century, the central marketplace was dismantled, and the park that still exists today was created. New apartment blocks were also built, though they bear no connection to the town’s historical look. Nowadays, the so-called historical center can be walked around in about 30 minutes. Among the town’s most notable and impressive buildings are the school buildings, churches, and a few administrative structures. The central park was renovated in 2024 during the mandate of Mayor Endre Márk.
