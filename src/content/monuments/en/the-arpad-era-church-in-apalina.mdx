    The Árpád-Era Church of Abafája

<ContentTextBlock>
The oldest surviving building in its original form in Szászrégen is the Roman Catholic church of Abafája. Dedicated to the Holy Cross, it is the city’s second oldest monument church, commissioned by the monastery of Kolozsmonostor. The semicircular apse and the part of the nave closest to the apse are Romanesque in style. The nave was extended in the 14th century, and the current tower was also built at that time. The church's western door and sacrament niche feature straight closures with supporting elements that recall late Gothic architecture, dating back to the 15th–16th centuries.

The village and the church once belonged to the monastery of Kolozsmonostor, but after numerous legal disputes, they became the property of Catholic landowners. The Huszár family contributed significantly to the church’s neo-Baroque interior furnishings; their coats of arms can be seen on the pulpit and the main altar. In 1930, major renovations were carried out on the church, during which it received its current roof.
