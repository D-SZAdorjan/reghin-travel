    Anton Badea Ethnographic Museum
</ContentTitle>
<ContentTextBlock>
The ethnographic museum founded by Anton Badea in 1960 primarily showcases the heritage of Romanian folk culture from the Upper Mureș Valley, the sub-Carpathian region of the Călimani Mountains, and the Transylvanian Plain. Initially, the museum contained 64 items of traditional clothing, but serious research work began in 1966. As a result, today it houses more than 7,000 objects and 27,000 photographs. The museum's first permanent exhibition opened in 1966, focusing on the folk art of the Gurghiu Valley. Between 1972 and 1991, the exhibition was expanded with folk costumes, folk art objects, and tools from the Upper Mureș Valley and the Plain region. In 2011, due to political pressure, the museum also began to present items of Hungarian folk art from the surrounding area. The museum also features an open-air section, where 14 buildings are furnished with traditional tools corresponding to each settlement. Among them are a wooden church, a stable with a barn, a mill, and several wine presses.

The building housing the museum's headquarters once belonged to an old Transylvanian noble family, the Borbereki Farkas family. At the end of the 19th century, the family was one of the largest landowners in Reghin and the surrounding area. According to documents, in 1493 Tamás Farkas was the deputy lord lieutenant of the Székelys. Mihály Farkas, a landowner in Dedrád and Széplak, was an enthusiastic participant in the 1848–49 revolution. One of Mihály Farkas’s grandsons, Gyula Farkas, was a major landowner in Magyarrégen and likely built the manor house in 1892. Another grandson, Albert, was the deputy lord lieutenant of Maros-Torda County and has an impressive grave in the Magyarrégen cemetery. Through marriage, the family is related to the Éltető family.
