    Petru Maior Wooden Church
</ContentTitle>
<ContentTextBlock>
According to some assumptions, it was built in 1725, while others suggest 1744 or perhaps 1776. What is certain is that the building known as the Petru Maior Church is one of the oldest monument-type churches in the city, and the most important monument for the Romanian community. If the documents are to be believed, it was likely built in 1744. Dedicated to Archangels Michael and Gabriel, the modestly sized church, 15 meters long and 14 meters high, is remarkable in several ways. Its unique feature is that, unlike the typical nave-based layout common in the region, this wooden church has a cross-shaped design, which is considered unique in Transylvania and is characteristic of wooden churches in Moldavia.

Two legends are associated with the wooden church, both offering an explanation for its Moldavian style. According to one tale, wealthy Macedonian merchants who frequently attended the fairs in Reghin noticed that the city’s Romanian population lacked a church building to offer blessings during their celebrations. Moved by compassion, the Macedonian merchants set out and brought a church from Moldavia for the Romanians. Another story claims that the local Romanian population built the church with the help of Macedonian architects, which is why it was constructed in the shape of a cross.

The church walls are made of unplastered pine logs, and its roof is covered with shingles. The interior is richly decorated, especially the icons and paintings on the wings of the hexagonal altar, which may date back to around 1789. The apse features icons of numerous Biblical figures, including the church’s two patron saints, Archangels Michael and Gabriel, as well as Mary and Saint Nicholas, likely painted in 1857. It is worth noting that Petru Maior, a prominent figure in Romanian cultural history and the Transylvanian School, began his pastoral service here between 1784 and 1809. His statue can be seen on the right side of the entrance gate to the cemetery leading to the church. Thanks to his efforts, the church was expanded in 1791 with a porch and a bell tower.

The Orthodox wooden church has undergone several minor and major renovations over the centuries to attain its present form. Following nationalization, the building was abandoned from 1948 for over 40 years, until 1985. In recent years, the wooden church owes much to Daniel Ciolocoiu, who, as the church’s priest, took numerous measures to preserve the building. Today, the church's most valuable paintings are kept in the Mureș County Museum.
