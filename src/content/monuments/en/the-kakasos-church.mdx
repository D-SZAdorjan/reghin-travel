    Rooster Church

The Reformed Church of Szászrégen, more commonly known as the Rooster Church, was built in 1890 based on the plans of Ignác Alpár. The most artistically valuable parts of the church are the pulpit and its crown, as well as the furniture, including the seats for elders and the clergy. The base of the pulpit was made of white carved stone by a stonemason from Magyarvista, András Szallós. The wooden structure of the pulpit was crafted by a local carpenter from Reghin, Ferenc Kiss.

Perhaps the most remarkable artistic feature of the church is the set of 180 ceiling panels (kazetták) painted by visual artist Dénes Molnár. These panels are distributed throughout various parts of the church: 100 are placed beneath the gallery, 24 on each side of the nave, and the remaining 32 in the ceiling of the vestibule. Some of the panels were painted by the artist between 1988 and 1989 to preserve the memory of several Transylvanian churches endangered by the threat of rural demolition. The 48 panels under the gallery were created to commemorate the millennial anniversary of the Hungarian conquest and the 3rd Hungarian Reformed World Assembly.

Among the panels, 24 depict domestic Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Evangelical churches, while the remaining panels illustrate churches from sister congregations in Switzerland, Hungary, Germany, and the Netherlands. The 32 panels in the vestibule feature Christian symbols.
