If we approach Szászrégen from the direction of Maroshévíz, right after passing the first roundabout, on the left side of the road we can see the notable manor of the Éltető family, which played an important role in the city’s economy in the second half of the 19th century. The flourishing of timber rafting in Szászrégen is linked to this family. In the 19th century, rafting on the Mureș and Görgény rivers gained increasing significance. Two small towns—Szászrégen and Lippa—played key roles in the rafting on the Mureș River. The trade of timber goods began at Régen on the upper section of the river and ended at Lippa on the lower section.

In 1853, those involved in rafting in Szászrégen founded a rafting company, and a year later, several merchants from Lippa joined the association. The people of Szászrégen undertook the procurement and transportation of timber, while the Lippa merchants handled its sale and distribution. Rafting mobilized large groups of people and provided work for many in the town, as it generated significant income. However, accidents were frequent; many developed rheumatism, and tuberculosis claimed many lives at the time. Timber could only be transported on the Mureș in spring, after snowmelt, and in autumn when the water level was high. Even then, there was a risk of crashing into rocks, and rafts that got stuck were often hit by others, which sometimes led to fatalities.

Éltető Dániel was the first in the town to conduct timber trade via rafting and is also associated with the founding of the first sawmill. The trade was continued by his son, József. After József’s death, the family business was taken over by his wife, Karolina Váradi Csukát, nicknamed "Mumu", who laid the foundation for the family’s wealth.

The family appears in Albert Wass’s novel *The Witch of Funtinel*, volume three (pages 193–196). In the story, Mr. Éltető is deeply shaken by the arrival of the railway, as he feared competition from Budapest and Szászrégen. Mumu, i.e., Karolina Váradi, was the main character in János Kemény’s novel *The Water Witch*. Lajos Kelemen writes the following about her: “She launched the long timber transports on the Mureș, sometimes as far as Szeged and other destinations. She recognized her men from afar, and they feared her more than the male members of the family. Everyone called her Mumu. She did the most and had the greatest merit in accumulating the family’s wealth.” The tombstone of the Water Witch can be seen in the left-side parcel of the Reformed Cemetery in Magyarrégen.
