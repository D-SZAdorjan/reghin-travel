The Pyramid of Violins monument was created by sculptor Ádám Barothi in 2001 to mark the 50th anniversary of violin making in Szászrégen. According to the sculptor, the statue symbolizes not only instrument making but also the city’s historical past. The 7.5-meter-tall statue depicts three violins, each facing a different street. On the violin facing the Evangelical Church, the artist engraved the coat of arms granted by Anjou Robert in 1330, which can also be found inside the church.

The city achieved great success in instrument making thanks to the Gliga and Hora violin factories, which have been operating since the 1950s and 60s. The secret to the success of the instruments produced here lies not only in the skilled and dedicated craftsmanship of the master builders but also in the high-quality maple and spruce trees that grow in the region. The violins have even reached overseas, where many renowned violinists have played them. A visit to the Gliga factory offers a glimpse into the process of instrument making.
