    Among the most significant archaeological discoveries is a nearly perfectly preserved Bronze Age belt buckle, approximately 3,200 years old, found in Mureșfelfalu, just 4 km from Reghin. This artifact has become a symbol of Mureș County and appears on its coat of arms.

    Looking at Nyerges Hill, a perforated stone axe was discovered there, which was a common tool used in everyday prehistoric life. Not only here, but also in the surrounding villages, numerous stone axes and pottery fragments have been found, all proving that this region was already inhabited in prehistoric times.

    These findings all prove that Reghin and its surroundings were ideal places to live for prehistoric humans. Around 3,200 years ago, their lives revolved around survival and meeting daily needs. They typically lived in small, nomadic groups and primarily engaged in hunting, fishing, and gathering.

    The proximity of the Mureș River provided them with drinking water and fishing opportunities, while the surrounding forests and mountains offered abundant game. Additionally, wood and stone were easily accessible for making tools and weapons. Thanks to the natural resources and abundant supply, prehistoric people were able to successfully take advantage of the environment in their daily lives around Reghin.

    Reghin in the Roman Era

    Two thousand years ago, the region that is now Transylvania was inhabited by the Dacians, a people who mainly ruled Dacia. However, their independence was brought to an end by the Roman Empire when it conquered Dacia in 106 AD and turned it into a Roman province.

    After the conquest of Dacia, the Romans established their estate system in Reghin and its surroundings as well. Numerous Roman coin finds, a castrum, and traces of an ancient Roman road all prove the presence of Romans here. It is believed that between 106–274 AD, a fortress stood on the site of the present-day Evangelical cemetery in Reghin, known as Rucunium.

    On the right bank of the Mureș River, beneath Reghin, a Roman stone-paved road once ran, which could be followed all the way to Vécs. In Mureșvécs lies one of the region’s most significant Roman castra. This road was connected to nearby salt deposits and salty water springs, through which salt was transported to other parts of the empire. Therefore, this area, including the town of Reghin, was considered a strategic and commercial hub.

    The Roman castrum established in Reghin, Rucunium, likely followed the structure of other castra. These were military camps built in easily defensible locations. A typical castrum was square or rectangular in shape, with towers on its corners and strong surrounding walls. The internal buildings were simple: barracks, warehouses, and the commander’s house. In the center of the courtyard stood the military headquarters building, surrounded by moats and walls.

    The Rucunium in Reghin likely played an important role in the region’s defense system. It may have controlled trade routes along the Mureș River and surrounding areas, which were essential for transporting salt and other basic goods. In addition, the fortress provided protection against local Dacian tribes, ensuring the empire’s security and stability in this important border region.
