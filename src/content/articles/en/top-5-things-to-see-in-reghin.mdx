    The Sächsisch Church of Reghin
</ContentTitle>
<ContentTextBlock>
    The Sächsisch Church in Reghin is the oldest and most prominent building in the city, and it is definitely worth visiting if you're in the area.
</ContentTextBlock>
<ContentTextBlock>
    The Sächsisch Church, towering in a picturesque setting, is one of Reghin's most valuable landmarks and symbols. The city's oldest building, commonly referred to simply as the Sächsisch Church, began construction in 1330, as attested by the oldest inscription in medieval Transylvania.

    From the outside, we can admire the Gothic structure of the church and its beautiful windows. Over the centuries, the Sächsisch Church burned several times and was severely damaged, but it always managed to survive. The most recent severe damage occurred in the 1848 fire, which destroyed much of the city, but the church remained standing. The church attained its present form thanks to restoration work by Gustav Müller between 1927 and 1930.

    Inside the Sächsisch Church, it's worth visiting the Chapel of St. Lawrence, where on the outer wall you can see a torso the size of a child, which likely represents St. Lawrence, the chapel's founder. Additionally, the monumental main altar and the larger-than-life Christ statue, created between 1857-58, are worth seeing. The church is also home to the largest organ in the region, built in 1849 by master organ builder Carl Schneider from Brașov. Today, the Sächsisch Church stands as a symbol of the city, a part of the Saxon heritage, and a monument that should not be missed when visiting Reghin.

    The Violin Pyramid Monument
</ContentTitle>
<ContentTextBlock>
    Opposite the Sächsisch Church, you will find another important landmark of the city, the Violin Pyramid monument, created by sculptor Ádám Barothi in 2001 to mark the 50th anniversary of violin manufacturing in Reghin. This striking work of art symbolizes not only violin-making but also the historical past of the city.

    The 7.5-meter-tall statue depicts three violins, each facing different streets. On the violin facing the Evangelical Church, the artist engraved the coat of arms granted by Robert of Anjou in 1330, which can also be found in the church.

<ContentTextBlock>
    Reghin is famous for its instrument manufacturing, particularly thanks to the Gliga and Hora instrument factories that started in the 1950s and '60s. The violins made here have gained international recognition, played by many renowned violinists. The secret to their success lies in the skillful and dedicated work of the craftsmen, along with the excellent quality of the maple and spruce that grow in the surrounding area.

    The Coat of Arms Fountain of Reghin
</ContentTitle>
<ContentTextBlock>
    One of Reghin's landmarks is the Coat of Arms Fountain located at the end of Salt Street, which features three city coats of arms from different eras. On the left side of the fountain, you can see the 1428 shield-shaped coat of arms, which depicts a six-pointed star and an Anjou lily, with the inscription O.P.R., which likely refers to the city's market town status. This coat of arms can also be found above the sacristy door of the Evangelical Church.
</ContentTextBlock>
<ContentTextBlock>
    In the center of the fountain is a simplified version of the city's 1848 coat of arms, which probably depicts a medieval messenger. The coat of arms on the right dates back to 1934 and shows a boatman wearing a hat, symbolizing the widespread practice of rafting on the Mureș River. The shield is crowned with three bastions.
</ContentTextBlock>
<ContentTextBlock>
    There is some debate about the 15th-century coat of arms, as historian Imre Schmidt argues that the city never used this emblem, and the shield-shaped coat of arms only came into use during the Renaissance. The letters on the banner may not be contemporary with the coat of arms, as the use of such letters only became fashionable in the second half of the 17th century.

    This small landmark is one of Reghin's historical sites and a significant part of the city's tourism, making it one of Reghin's top attractions. You can read more about the Coat of Arms Fountain HERE.

    The Main Square of Reghin
</ContentTitle>
<ContentTextBlock>
    Among Reghin's landmarks is the city's Main Square, the Old Town, which is attractive not only for its historic buildings but also for its park, a great place to relax. If you're visiting Reghin, the central square is definitely one of the top attractions where you can discover the rich history and cultural heritage of the city.
</ContentTextBlock>
<ContentTextBlock>
    The historical layout of Reghin's main square was similar to other medieval Transylvanian towns. Its buildings were made of wood and clay, with straw-covered roofs, and only a few important buildings were made of stone. Its streets were narrow, winding, and dirty. During the great fire of 1848, three-quarters of the city burned down, after which the beautiful Neo-Baroque, Neo-Classical, and Art Nouveau buildings, considered modern at the time, were constructed, which can still be admired today.

    Vilmos Hankó, in his 1896 book "Székelyföld," describes the city as follows: "Reghin is a small town of about six thousand inhabitants on the right bank of the Mureș River, with a picturesque large square surrounded by lush trees and orchards, a rare sight. Its large houses, palaces, stylish hotels, well-paved streets, and splendid promenades pleasantly surprise the passing traveler."
