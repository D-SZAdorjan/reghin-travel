              First Mention of the Settlement and Name Variations
            </ContentTitle>
            <ContentTextBlock>
              The first written mention of Szászrégen is in 1228 under the name
              Regun. It appears in the deed of donation when King Andrew II
              grants the lands of Széplak and Gyeke, taken from Simon Ban
              (guilty of murdering Queen Gertrude), to Dénes, the treasurer.
              Over the centuries, the name of the settlement changed several
              times. Its market town status is indicated by the 1427 mention of
              &quot;oppidum Regen.&quot; The name Szász-Régen, still in use today, first
              appeared in 1733. In 1854, the settlement was mentioned in three
              languages: in Hungarian as SzászRégen, in Saxon as Saschisch Reen,
              and in Romanian as Reghin. The current Szászrégen consists of
              Szász- and Magyarrégen, administratively united in 1926, and the
              villages Abafája and Radnótfája, annexed in 1956.

              Prehistoric Remains of Szászrégen
            </ContentTitle>
            <ContentTextBlock>
              According to archaeological finds, the history of Szászrégen dates
              back to prehistoric times. The presence of ancient human cultures
              is evidenced by artifacts found in the city and surrounding
              villages. In Marosfelfalu, a perfectly preserved bronze-age belt
              buckle approximately 3200 years old was found. On Nyerges Hill, a
              pierced stone axe was discovered, along with many other stone axes
              and ceramic fragments in nearby settlements.

            <ContentTitle size="xl">Szászrégen in the Roman Era</ContentTitle>
            <ContentTextBlock>
              After the Roman conquest of Dacia, the Romans established their
              estate system in the city and its surroundings. The presence of
              Romans is evidenced by Roman coins, castrums, and traces of Roman
              roads found in and around Szászrégen. It is assumed that between
              106-274, a fortress stood on the site of the current Evangelical
              cemetery, traditionally called Rucunium. Remains of Roman castrums
              were also found in Marosvécs, Mikháza, Sóvárad, and Nyerges Hill.
              A Roman stone-paved road ran along the right bank of the Maros
              River beneath the city and could be followed all the way to Vécs.
              This road was connected to nearby salt mines and salty springs,
              likely used to transport salt to other parts of the empire. With a
              keen eye, one can still discern traces of the Roman road today.

              Medieval Szászrégen: Royal Estate and Mongol Invasions
            </ContentTitle>
            <ContentTextBlock>
              In the Middle Ages, Szászrégen and its region were royal property
              and belonged to Torda County. A royal castle stood in nearby
              Görgényszentimre, now only ruins remain. In the 12th century,
              during the reign of King Géza II, German settlers were invited to
              the area. In 1241 and 1285, Mongols ravaged the town, but in the
              latter attack, King Ladislaus IV’s army successfully repelled the
              invaders.

            <ContentTextBlock>
              According to legend, the city’s pious citizens tried to soften the
              Mongols by approaching them in a procession with priests, church
              songs, and flags. However, upon meeting, the Mongols mercilessly
              slaughtered everyone. The 1241-42 invasions caused great material
              and human loss in the region. To repopulate, Dénes of Losonc
              invited German settlers from Flanders and the Rhine region.

              The settlement’s first major architectural structure was a grand
              early Gothic church dedicated to Mary, first mentioned in 1330. It
              was likely built a century earlier when the Saxons settled. That
              same year, it became an ecclesiastical deanery and two years
              later, a chapter that received the taxes of ten villages. A school
              also operated alongside the chapter, playing a vital role in
              spreading knowledge and literacy. László Losonczy, envoy of Queen
              Elizabeth, received authorization in Rome to build a monastery for
              the Augustinian hermits beside the church.

            <ContentTitle size="xl">Szászrégen’s Economic Rise</ContentTitle>
            <ContentTextBlock>
              By the 15th century, Szászrégen rapidly developed economically and
              socially, becoming one of the wealthiest towns in Northern
              Transylvania. A 1483 document mentions a Latin-language school
              established by the Saxons, led by a teacher named Petrus. The
              city’s advantageous location, valuable vineyards, and skilled
              artisans all contributed to its economic importance. Gaining
              market town status in the early 15th century allowed it
              self-governance and first-instance jurisdiction. Citizens gained
              urban privileges, including exemption from corvée and freedom of
              movement. Szászrégen’s legal rights in organizing fairs and guilds
              further solidified its central role.

            <ContentTextBlock>
              From 1427, the town held four national fairs annually and weekly
              markets on Thursdays. Medieval fair traditions are still preserved
              today. With the formation of industrial guilds, skilled craftsmen
              could better utilize their talents. Initially, guilds grouped
              various trades for collective interest, but by the late 16th
              century, they became more specialized. The butcher’s guild was
              established in 1570, tanners in 1662, and saddlers in 1681. By the
              18th century, 17 guilds operated in the city.

            <ContentTextBlock>
              Szászrégen’s peaceful period lasted until the late 16th century,
              followed by war and plague. During the 16th and 17th centuries,
              the city was repeatedly plundered and burned. In 1564, Emperor
              Maximilian’s troops occupied the town, later liberated by John
              Sigismund’s forces. The 15 Years’ War then plagued the region.
              Despite early Christian League victories, Turkish forces
              retaliated. Foreign armies from both Habsburg general Basta and
              Székely Mózes ravaged the area. In 1602, Captain Péter Konkoly
              burned the city. In 1613, Tatars pillaged Upper Mureș Valley.
              After George II Rákóczi’s failed Polish campaign, Turkish forces
              devastated Transylvania for over four years. In nearby
              Görgényszentimre, Rákóczi’s council drafted the first legal codex
              of Transylvania in 1653.

              Meanwhile, the Transylvanian Diet elected János Kemény as Prince
              of Transylvania on January 1, 1661, at the Szászrégen Evangelical
              Church, replacing Ákos Barcsai. The Ottoman Grand Vizier promised
              to recognize Kemény if he acted in service of the empire. However,
              Kemény sided with the Habsburgs, leading to Ottoman retaliation.
              In 1662, he was defeated at Segesvár by Pasha Ali, whose army
              devastated the region, including Szászrégen. A plague the
              following year worsened the situation. Despite hardships,
              development continued. During Rákóczi’s War of Independence, the
              city was affected again, and in 1708 the Evangelical church burned
              down. Additional challenges included Tatar raids (1690–1711),
              drought, famine, and another plague.

            <ContentTextBlock>
              The 1848–49 revolution and war of independence marked a turning
              point in Szászrégen’s history. Ethnic tensions and unresolved
              peasant issues alienated Romanians and Saxons from the Hungarian
              cause, leading to internal conflict. In Szászrégen, Lieutenant
              Colonel Urban commanded six companies to defend the town. However,
              Székely troops defeated them near Vajdaszentivány. On November 1,
              Székelys entered the town. When a war levy wasn’t paid, they
              looted the town. A fire broke out during the pillaging, destroying
              much of the town. Almost nothing remained of the pre-1848 city,
              and crucial documents were lost. Over 397 buildings were
              destroyed, with the Evangelical church suffering the most damage.
              Despite this, real development began after 1850, aided by
              industrialization.

            <ContentTextBlock>
              From the second half of the 19th century, Szászrégen became one of
              the most important timber trade centers in Transylvania. After the
              1848 fire, the city center was rebuilt with neo-Baroque and
              neoclassical buildings. A large square and main street were
              created. The tallest building in the region, a two-story hotel,
              was built. In 1863, it became a free royal city, and in 1876, a
              city with organized council under the new administrative law.
              Residents engaged in agriculture, crafts, and trade. In 1877, it
              became part of the new Maros-Torda county. Timber was transported
              via the Mureș River, and by the late 19th century, rafting was
              booming. The Székelykocsárd–Marosvásárhely railway extension
              reached Szászrégen in 1888 and Déda in 1905. Major industries
              included distilleries, sawmills, and textile factories, along with
              leather, blacksmith, and cart-making industries.

              Industrial growth at the end of the 19th and start of the 20th
              centuries brought many small and large enterprises. Notable
              factories included the 1874 Farkas Mendel distillery and sawmills
              by Schwartz Mendel and János Müler. Despite the World Wars, the
              city’s economy flourished between them. After WWII, small
              businesses gradually gave way to larger enterprises. The city
              power plant, built in 1911, used free hydro power to generate
              electricity, primarily for local industries. Szászrégen was known
              for the Silva brewery, once producing some of Romania’s best beer.
              The brewery was sold and abandoned, though its concrete structure
              still stands today.

              Wood processing became dominant in Szászrégen, particularly
              instrument making, thanks to the Hora and Gliga factories. The
              surrounding forests provided excellent spruce and maple for
              instrument crafting. Instruments made here won international
              competitions and were played by greats like Yehudi Menuhin.
              Szászrégen earned the nickname &quot;City of Violins,&quot; symbolized by
              Ádám Barothi’s Violin Pyramid statue. Notable companies included
              Irum SA (1953), manufacturing tractors and parts, and Republica
              (later Metalurgica), a metalworks factory. The Alpina sports
              equipment company and IPL, a major wood processing firm in the
              1980s, were also key players.

              After WWII, the city quickly recovered and began to develop.
              Industry, education, and healthcare improved. A large park was
              created in the market square to prevent large public gatherings
              and protests. In the early 2000s, the city expanded with new
              housing blocks and two new churches. In the Unirii neighborhood,
              the St. George Orthodox and nearby monumental Greek Catholic
              churches were built. In 1994, Szászrégen was declared a
              municipality with county-level rights.

              As Szászrégen’s history, traditions, and values fade into the

              centuries of hardship, the town always managed to rise and grow
              again. As Éva Marjai said, Szászrégen is a good example of how to
              rise from losses, use opportunities wisely, and build a future.
