        title: "1. Reghin’s Main Square and Its History",
        content: "It’s best to start the walk in the central park of Reghin. The park was renovated in 2024 and is a pleasant place for a stroll. However, not so long ago, it used to be full of chicken droppings and bustling activity, as this area once was a huge square used as a marketplace. Due to its favorable location, Reghin rapidly developed both economically and socially in the past. After being granted market town status in the 15th century along with the right to hold fairs, there was no stopping its growth. It soon became one of the richest towns in Northern Transylvania. From 1427 onward, it was permitted to host four national fairs annually and a weekly Thursday market. The tradition of hosting fairs continues today, although not in the park but further west in the city. Unfortunately, during communism, the central square was turned into a park to prevent people from gathering and rebelling against the regime. I invite you to continue reading about Reghin’s full history here, where I detail its development, the settlement of the Saxons, its economy, how the center was formed, and everything else."

        title: "1. The Reghin Fire and the Subsequent Economic Boom",
        content: "Feel free to explore the center of Reghin, which was mostly built after 1850. A fire broke out accidentally during a looting in a merchant’s shop, and since the houses at that time were mostly made of wood and mud, more than 397 residential buildings were destroyed, including both secular and religious structures. The damage was estimated at 1.5 million forints—a significant sum at that time. Despite this, Reghin's real development began after 1850. The industrial revolution positively influenced the town’s economic, industrial, and commercial activities. From the second half of the 19th century, Reghin became the most significant timber trade town in Transylvania. After the great fire of 1848, the city center took on a new look. Modern buildings in neo-Baroque and neoclassical styles replaced the old ones, and these are the buildings we can still see today."

        title: "1. The Former District Court Building of Reghin",
        content: "While walking in the city center, it’s worth visiting one of the most impressive buildings in Reghin's main square, which now houses the Alexandru Ceuşianu General School. The building was constructed around the 1870s in a classical style and once served as the headquarters of the Royal Hungarian District Court. Interestingly, the adjacent prison was considered part of the building. If you're lucky and can ask to enter, you might be able to see a beautiful fresco depicting Justitia, the Roman goddess personifying justice, likely painted during the court’s era. Another surprise awaits inside—during the last renovation, portraits of the kings of the Árpád dynasty were discovered on the column capitals in the lobby, though unfortunately, they were covered with lime again after the renovation."

        title: "1. The Heraldic Fountain of Reghin",
        content: "Another promising attraction in the center of Reghin is the Heraldic Fountain at the end of Salt Street, which displays three different coats of arms from Reghin’s history. It’s about a 2-3 minute walk from the school building. Here you’ll see, on the left side of the fountain, what is likely the town’s first coat of arms from 1428. It is a targe-shaped shield divided by a diagonal band. In the upper left corner (heraldically speaking), there is a six-pointed star; in the lower right, an Anjou lily. The diagonal band reads 'O.P.R.', presumably meaning *Oppidum Privilegiatum Regun*, referring to Reghin’s status as a privileged market town. You can read more about the fountain here."

        title: "1. The Saxon Church and the Violin Pyramid",
        content: "The next stop on our walk is Reghin’s most valuable and esteemed building: the Saxon Church. It’s a 3-minute walk from the Heraldic Fountain—use Google Maps for help. Before reaching the church, you’ll notice a statue: the Violin Pyramid monument, created by sculptor Ádám Barothi in 2001 to mark 50 years of violin making in Reghin. According to the sculptor, the monument symbolizes not only instrument making but also Reghin’s historical past. You can read more about the statue here. The Saxon Church began construction in the 1300s in Gothic style. Due to several fires, it underwent many reconstructions and reached its current form between 1927 and 1930. If you're lucky, you can enter the church. I won't detail everything here because it would take too long, but you can click here for a full description."

    "After the 1848 fire, the only building remaining from the old town was the Evangelical Church. The Saxon Church alone survived the massive fire, making it part of the Saxon heritage, and many view it as a symbol of the city.",
    "John Kemény was elected Prince here on January 1st, 1661.",
    "A defensive wall was built around the church in the 16th century due to fears of Turkish and Tatar attacks. Reghin's fortress was likely built in 1501 and is shown on Johannes Honterus's 1532 map. It was probably a fortified structure surrounded by a moat, with two towers and stone walls.",
    "An inscription from 1555 on one of the stone walls read: “There is no salvation in war, we all desire peace.”",
    "According to legend, the chapel of the Saxon Church was built by a very wealthy monk named Saint Lawrence, who believed that after the chapel's completion, he would still have enough money to live worry-free. However, when the construction finished, he had only enough left for a single egg—he ate it in sorrow and died.",
    "Another tale tells that in 1848, a Franciscan monk named Veress from Mikháza claimed he found a document in the monastery’s archive proving that a great treasure was hidden under a stone grape cluster in the Saxon Church. It was allegedly placed there by the church's builder to fund rebuilding in case of fire or damage. Sadly, the treasure has never been found, though it would have been especially useful after the 1848 fire. You can click here to read more about the church."
