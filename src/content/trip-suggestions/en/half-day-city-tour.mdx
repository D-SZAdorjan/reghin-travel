        "title": "1. Discover Reghin's Main Square and Park",
        "content": "I recommend starting your city tour in Reghin's central park. Imagine that this park used to be a huge square where large weekly markets were held. People from surrounding villages came here to buy and sell. But these markets were not just about trade—they were culturally important, as friends, relatives, and acquaintances met here, and gossip spread. Village girls also often came to find potential husbands. Reghin's first written mention was in 1228 under the name Regun. In the 12th century, during King Géza II's reign, German settlers arrived here, and until WWII, the city was mainly inhabited by Saxons. Reghin was famous for its markets, valuable vineyards, and skilled craftsmen. The current buildings in the center are results of a modernization wave following the 1850s. I recommend checking out the town hall, the former district courthouse, and the old city hotel. Click here to read more about the city's general history."

        "title": "2. Learn About the Saxon Church",
        "content": "The second main stop of our walk is Reghin’s iconic symbol, the Saxon Church. Construction began in 1330, and it is one of the most outstanding examples of Saxon architecture in the city. Over the centuries, it suffered severe damage multiple times, but thanks to the perseverance of the locals, we can still admire it today. Don't miss exploring the church's interior, where you can see its large organ, monumental main altar, and life-sized statue of Christ. This 700-year-old church is surrounded by many legends and stories. Read more."

        "title": "3. Violin Pyramid Monument",
        "content": "Opposite the Saxon Church, you'll find one of Reghin's notable landmarks—the Violin Pyramid monument. This remarkable statue was created by sculptor Ádám Baróthi in 2001 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of violin-making in Reghin. The 7.5-meter-tall work features three violins facing three different streets, symbolizing the city's violin-making tradition. Read more."

    {
        "title": "4. Reghin Coat of Arms Fountain",
        "content": "Another sight worth visiting in Reghin is the Coat of Arms Fountain located at the end of Salt Street. It showcases three city coats of arms from different eras. On the left is the 1428 emblem, featuring a six-pointed star and the Anjou lily. The center displays the 1848 version, likely depicting a medieval herald. The right-side 1934 emblem symbolizes rafting on the Mureș River. This fountain is an important historical monument that preserves Reghin's past through its heraldic symbols. Read more."

        "title": "5. István Kohl Zoological Museum",
        "content": "Our next stop is the István Kohl Zoological Museum, though currently, you need permission from Lucian Blaga High School to enter, as the exhibit is housed in one of the school buildings. Address: Str. Vânatorilor 29-31, Reghin 545300. István Kohl, an ornithologist, museologist, and taxidermist, was born in Reghin on July 30, 1922. He created his famous and vast zoological collection at this high school. The collection includes around 2,300 prepared birds, 3,600 partial bird skeletons, 164 mammals, and about 1,000 mammal skulls. Read more."

    {
        "title": "6. Reghin Ethnographic Museum",
        "content": "Close to the school, just a 3-minute walk away, is Reghin's Ethnographic Museum, which is well worth a visit. Founded in 1960 by Anton Badea, the museum showcases the folk culture heritage of Upper Mureș Valley, the Pre-Carpathians of the Călimani Mountains, and the Transylvanian Plain. Initially, it contained 64 ethnographic items, and research truly began in 1966. Today, the museum houses over 7,000 items and 27,000 photos. Its first permanent exhibition opened in 1966, focusing on the folk art of the Gurghiu Valley. From 1972–1991, the exhibition expanded with traditional attire and artifacts from Upper Mureș Valley and the Transylvanian Plain. Due to political pressure, in 2011 the museum began showcasing Hungarian folk art items from the area. The museum also has an open-air section with 14 buildings, each furnished with traditional tools representing different villages. Noteworthy among them are the wooden church, stable with barn, mill, and some wine presses. Read more about the museum HERE. Opening hours: Weekdays from 8 AM to 6 PM. Address: Strada Vînătorilor 51, Reghin 545300. Phone: 0265 512 571"

        "title": "7. Petru Maior and the Wooden Church",
        "content": "The final stop of our walk is a charming small wooden church named after Reghin’s famous native, Petru Maior. He was one of the most outstanding figures in Reghin’s history: a priest, philosopher, teacher, and writer, and a key representative of the Transylvanian School. He worked in the city for over 24 years, supporting the emancipation of the Romanian minority. As a teacher, he paid particular attention to the quality of Romanian-language education, and as a priest, he effectively guided the community morally. This church is a beautiful memorial honoring Petru Maior's legacy. Read more. The construction date of the wooden church is debated—some say 1725, others 1744, or even 1776—but it is certainly one of the oldest monuments in Reghin and the most important Romanian monument in the city. Documents suggest it was built in 1744. Dedicated to Archangels Michael and Gabriel, the church is relatively small—15 meters long and 14 meters high. Interestingly, while wooden churches in the countryside typically have a nave floor plan, this one is cross-shaped, which is unique in Transylvania and more typical of Moldavian wooden churches. Two legends are associated with the church that explain its Moldavian characteristics. Read more."
