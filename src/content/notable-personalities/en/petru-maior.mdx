Among the most prominent figures of Reghin is the priest, philosopher, teacher, and writer Petru Maior, a distinguished representative of the Transylvanian School, who carried out his work in the city for more than 24 years, supporting the emancipation of the Romanian minority. He was born in 1754 in Târgu Mureș, the son of a dean. He began his studies in his hometown between 1769 and 1772, and continued them in Blaj until 1774. Thanks to his father’s connections and with the support of the bishop of Fogaras, he traveled to Rome between 1774 and 1779, where he studied philosophy and theology, and then for one year, until 1780, he studied at the University of Vienna. After completing his studies, he returned to Blaj, where for four years, from 1780 to 1784, he taught theology and logic in a secondary school. Due to disagreements with Bishop Ioan Bob, he left Blaj and settled in Reghin, where he served as the priest of the Romanian Greek Catholic community of Magyarrégen and the dean of Gurghiu-Sângeorgiu de Mureș for more than 24 years, until 1809. Afterward, he moved to Budapest, where he held a position as a reviser and censor at the royal printing house until his death in 1821. The Romanians in Budapest founded a reading circle named after him, the Petru Maior Reading Society, which operated until the outbreak of World War I in 1914.

During his activity in Reghin, he worked against the oppression of the Romanian minority and for the enforcement of their rights. As a teacher, he paid great attention to the quality of Romanian-language education. As a priest, with his experience in the moral education of the masses, he was able to influence people through his church sermons. In his view, during times of national oppression, the church should become the center of intellectual life and a forum where political organization is also possible. Petru Maior published numerous historical, philosophical, and ecclesiastical works, which contributed to the formation, development, and strengthening of Romanian national consciousness. Among his most significant works are *On the Origin of the Romanians in Dacia* (1812) and *On the History of the Romanian Church* (1813).
