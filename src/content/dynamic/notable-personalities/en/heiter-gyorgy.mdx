One of the city's most famous personalities, György Heiter was born on June 21, 1871, in Szászrégen. He began learning the violin before the age of 8, but due to the family's financial decline, his music education was soon interrupted. He had to pursue an industrial career and studied photography. However, he did not stray far from music, as he was invited to the Szászrégen Philharmonic as the orchestra’s photographer. During his school years, he also spent time in Brașov, where he did not let his musical talent go to waste and became the conductor of the Brașov Liederkanz. Later, he went on a journey and visited Vienna and Munich several times, where, alongside photography, he also refined his musical studies. Upon returning to Szászrégen, he opened his own photography studio in 1895. He soon became the most famous photographer in the region, creating portraits, postcards, wedding photos, landscapes, and hunting scenes. He captured the portraits of renowned individuals such as Crown Prince Rudolf, Samu Teleki, Ferdinand I, Charles II, and Michael I. In recognition of his merits, he was awarded the title of Royal Photographer in 1908.

His photographic talent was also acknowledged by Romanian King Ferdinand I during his visit to Szászrégen in 1922. Heiter conducted the serenade performed in the king’s honor, after which Ferdinand I remarked: "I never thought you were a musical court photographer." He further proved his talent at the 1928 photo exhibition in Bucharest, where he won a gold medal for his artistic photographs. Despite his business commitments, he made time for music as well; first, he was a member of the Szászrégen string quartet, later elected as conductor of the Szászrégen Männergesangverein. In 1905, he became the head of the Hungarian Civic Choir of Szászrégen.

With the city’s economic, social, and intellectual development in the second half of the 19th century came the spread of culture among the population through education, theater, music, and singing. The Hungarian Civic Choir, founded in 1883, undertook much of this cultural mission, significantly aided by the city’s excellent photographer and conductor, György Heiter.

Under György Heiter’s leadership, the choir returned from the national singing competition in Budapest in 1912 with second prize. They went on to win first prizes three times: in Sighișoara in 1928, and in Cluj in 1931 and 1938. Thanks to their successes and Heiter’s selfless efforts, the Szászrégen choir became widely known and highly esteemed throughout the region. The choir officially disbanded on October 6, 1984, on the occasion of its 100th anniversary.

The choir members celebrated the notable anniversaries of the choir's founding. For the 25th anniversary, they inaugurated the choir's flag during a grand ceremony. The green flag, embroidered in gold, reads “Hungarian Civic Choir of Szászrégen 1884–1909” on one side, and on the other: “Our sweet homeland, our beloved song, we live for you, we die for you!” The flag can still be seen today in the Reformed Church of Szászrégen.

In 1930, the choir organized a concert in honor of György Heiter’s more than 25 years of leadership. According to a contemporary article in the newspaper *Maros*, over a thousand people gathered in the grand hall of the Szászrégen City Hotel to celebrate Heiter’s decades of selfless service to Hungarian culture on the occasion of his 25th anniversary as conductor. In a short conversation, György Heiter shared that he had been involved with music since the age of 12. He frequently traveled to Germany, where he also participated in the musical scene. He had been living in Szászrégen for 25 years and had been the conductor of the Hungarian Choir from the very beginning. Despite being of Saxon ethnicity, he devoted all his energy and dedication to serving the cause selflessly. By 1935, György Heiter had been the conductor and musical director of the Hungarian Civic Choir for over 30 years. His 30th anniversary as conductor was marked by another grand celebration similar to the previous one.

György Heiter was the conductor of the Hungarian Civic Choir for over 40 years (1905–1940). In recognition of his selfless activity and merits, the Choral Association elected him first as district conductor, then as national conductor. He passed away on March 13, 1947, and was laid to eternal rest in the Evangelical Cemetery of Szászrégen. His birthplace was nationalized, and today it houses a casino and a fast-food restaurant.
