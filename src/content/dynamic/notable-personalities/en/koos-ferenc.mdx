He was an active son of his time, a teacher working for the upliftment of the people, and the first leading spirit of the Hungarian community in Bucharest. His social and cultural organizing work alone would deserve our attention. In addition, Ferenc Koós was a writer—warm-hearted, truthful, someone who thought in terms of the whole people, a lively chronicler who continued the best traditions of Transylvanian memoirists. He rose from a peasant boy to a patriot, from a servant student to an educational inspector, a soldier of Bem in 1848, and a major figure of the Hungarian community in Bucharest in the 19th century—the first truly distinguished Hungarian intellectual who spent over a decade and a half as an apostle in the Romanian capital. He was the organizer of cultural societies and a promoter and advocate of Romanian-Hungarian understanding. He was the author of a much-mentioned but little-read memoir. – According to the description by György Beke.

Ferenc Koós was born on October 18, 1828, into a serf family in Reghin (Magyarrégen). The defining experiences of his childhood were serf labor, shepherd life, rafting on the Mureș River, village customs, Easter sprinkling, and Christmas caroling. The only path to rise from serfdom was education. His opportunity to break out was thanks to Zsigmond Hegyessy, who noticed him and accepted him as a servant student at the college in Târgu Mureș. From 1840 to 1848, he was a servant student. After the outbreak of the War of Independence, he became a national guard and then a Kossuth hussar. For a time, he also fought in General Bem’s army. After the war was suppressed, he completed his college studies and in 1855 arrived in Bucharest as a Reformed pastor, where he spent more than fifteen years. During this time, he accomplished pioneering work. In addition to his pastoral duties, his responsibilities included the spiritual care of Reformed believers in Romanian-inhabited regions—Moldavia and Wallachia—and teaching in the Hungarian-language Reformed elementary school in Bucharest. He visited the Csángó villages and compiled reports on them by church district, village, population, and the church language used.

Thanks to him, the first Hungarian cultural center in Bucharest—Hunnia—was established, and with its support, he founded the first Hungarian newspaper in Romania, the *Bukaresti Magyar Közlöny* (Hungarian Bulletin of Bucharest). Among the Hungarian intellectuals in Bucharest, he was the first to research the history of Hungarian settlement in Wallachia. Through his work in the Romanian capital, he is considered the founder of the social and cultural life of Hungarians living there.

After returning to Transylvania, in 1870 he obtained a teaching and later a principal position at the teacher training school in Deva. In 1873, he was transferred to Bistrița-Năsăud County, where he became a royal school inspector. Noteworthy is his work between 1876–78, when he organized the education of talented and intelligent children at the Târgu Mureș College. In 1878, he was appointed as inspector in Brașov. He took his role seriously and upheld strict standards in education, adhering to the spirit of proper and effective teaching. He despised teachers who used corporal punishment. He embraced modern pedagogical principles, believing that youth should be educated in useful and intelligent studies, that education should be eased, and that students should be encouraged to enjoy learning. In 1883, in recognition of his work, he was awarded the title of "Royal Counselor."

Ferenc Koós retired in 1890 and remained in Brașov until his death in 1905. In the year of his retirement, his most important work was published—his two-volume autobiographical account titled *My Life and Memories*, which preserved important information about Reghin. He also wrote a biography of the 17th-century educator János Apáczai Csere. During his career, he wrote thousands of articles, reports, daily notes, and translated Gypsy and Romanian folktales as well as Italian short stories. Over his lifetime, he contributed to 37 Hungarian-language newspapers. In honor of his achievements, a memorial plaque was placed on the wall of his birthplace.
