Joseph Haltrich, a renowned native of the city, was a teacher, ethnographer, historian, and folklorist. He was born on July 22, 1822, in Reghin. He had a special interest in researching the history of his own people, which accompanied him throughout his entire career. He completed his elementary education in his hometown and continued his high school studies in Sighișoara, then obtained his higher education at the distant German universities of Leipzig and Berlin. During this time, he attended lectures on classical German philosophy, history, and theology. He spent his vacations traveling through Germany's main cultural centers. After completing his studies in Germany, he first returned to his hometown, then to Sighișoara. After the bloody suppression of the revolution, from 1849 onward, he worked for more than 24 years as a teacher at the Evangelical Gymnasium in Sighișoara, serving as the rector between 1869 and 1872, and later served the church until his death. He passed away in 1886, weakened by illness. In recognition of his work, the Sighișoara high school where he taught for 24 years was named after him in 1972.

In addition to his teaching work, Haltrich zealously researched the areas inhabited by his ancestors, the Saxons. He collected various poems, folk songs, legends, and customs. He was greatly influenced by the tales of the Brothers Grimm and German classical romanticism. He left behind a rich and profound legacy of folklore, ethnographic, and local historical research for future generations. His first work, titled *Sächsische Volksmärchen aus Siebenbürgen*, was published in 1856.

He studied German literature and the language spoken by the people in depth, including various dialects, especially Saxon usage and peculiar expressions. His main goal was to supplement the previously collected vocabulary—which he considered incomplete—with new, systematic collections. He developed this idea into a plan titled *Plan zu Vorarbeiten für ein Idiotikon der siebenbürgisch-sächsischen Volkssprache* (Kronstadt, 1865). In his vocabulary, he included more than one and a half hundred Hungarian words used in the Saxon dialect. According to his findings, many German words entered Saxon through Hungarian. His great desire was to publish a dictionary of the Transylvanian German language. At the end of his life, he entrusted the collected folklore materials to a dear acquaintance, J. Wolff, who published the collection in Vienna in 1885 under the title *Zur Volkskunde der Siebenbürgen Sachsen*.

Joseph Haltrich did not forget his hometown, Reghin, as he visited it several times and maintained a constant connection with it. He was among the first people to seriously study the history of Reghin. He wrote the city's history titled *Zur Geschichte von Sächsisch-Regen seit den letzten hundert Jahren* (1857). In the words of Donát Bíró: Haltrich was one of the most enlightened Transylvanian Saxon scholars.
