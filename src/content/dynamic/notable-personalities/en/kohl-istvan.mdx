István Kohl, ornithologist, museologist, and taxidermist, was born on July 30, 1922, in Reghin. He completed his schooling at the German-language elementary school and high school. After high school, he moved to nearby Târgu Mureș, where he learned the furrier trade. Upon returning home, he learned taxidermy in his father's workshop, a skill he later applied while briefly working at the Hunting Museum in Focșani. Returning to his hometown, he worked as a laboratory assistant, first at the teacher training school and later at High School No. 2. It was in this high school that he established his famous and extensive zoological collection. The ornithological and mammal collection includes around 2,300 mounted birds, 3,600 partial bird skeletons, 164 mammals, and about 1,000 mammal skulls. The museum contributes to expanding natural science education and arouses students’ interest in nature. The museum is located in the courtyard of the Lucian Blaga Technological High School, but unfortunately, it is closed to the public.

Throughout his life, he authored several journals, 123 scientific papers, and co-authored two books: *Birds of Transylvania, Volume III* and *About the Carpathian Brown Bear*. He was a member of the Romanian Ornithological Society, the Saxon Ornithological Society of Dresden, and a regular observer for the Hungarian Ornithological Institute. He participated in numerous domestic and international ornithological scientific conferences. István Kohl was not only involved in nature but also in music. For decades, he was an active participant in the city's musical life. In 1945, he organized a brass band, taught music at the music school for ten years, and was a member of the former symphonic orchestra of High School No. 2.

As a person, he was morally upright, known affectionately by everyone as “Uncle Pista.” He lived a happy family life, and was a modest, helpful, and conscientious man, highly respected among his friends. His peaceful and successful life came to an end on March 24, 1998. Quoting Endre Sárkány-Kiss: "On March 27, 1998, many accompanied him on his final journey; the entire community of Reghin, young and old, was present because István Kohl was an extraordinary citizen of the small town. He was a one-man institution in Reghin, and people gathered from all corners of Transylvania, for perhaps we were burying the last self-taught scientist of Transylvania." Through his work and personal conduct, István Kohl justly earned the honorary title of citizen of the town, posthumously.
