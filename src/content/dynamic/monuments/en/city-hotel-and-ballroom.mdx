If we approach Szászrégen from the direction of Maroshévíz, right after leaving the first roundabout, on the left side of the road we can see the notable mansion of the Éltető family, which played an important role in the urban economy in the second half of the 19th century. The rise of the timber rafting trade in Szászrégen is linked to this family. In the 19th century, rafting on the Mureș and Görgény rivers gained increasing significance. Two small towns—Szászrégen and Lippa—played a key role in rafting on the Mureș River. The trade in timber started in Régen on the upper section of the river and ended in Lippa on the lower section. In 1853, those involved in rafting in Szászrégen founded a rafting company, and a year later, several merchants from Lippa joined the company. The people of Szászrégen undertook the procurement and transportation of the timber, while the merchants from Lippa were responsible for its sale and distribution.

Rafting mobilized large numbers of people and provided work for many in the town, as it generated considerable income. However, accidents were frequent—many people developed rheumatism, and tuberculosis claimed numerous lives at that time. Timber could only be transported on the Mureș in spring, after the snow melted, and in autumn, when water levels were high. Even so, there was always the danger of crashing into rocks, and other rafts could pile up on stranded ones, often resulting in fatalities.

In the town, Dániel Éltető was the first to handle the timber trade and is also credited with founding the first sawmill. His son, József, continued the craft. After József's death, the family business was taken over by his wife, Karolina Váradi Csukát, known as “Mumu,” who laid the foundation for the family’s wealth. The family appears in the third volume (pages 193–196) of Albert Wass's novel *The Witch of Funtinel*. In the story, Mr. Éltető suffers a great emotional shock due to the arrival of the railway, fearing competition from Budapest and Szászrégen. Mumu—i.e. Karolina Váradi—was the main character in János Kemény’s novel *The Water Witch*. Lajos Kelemen writes of her: “She initiated the long timber transports on the Mureș, sometimes as far as Szeged and other destinations. She could recognize her workers from afar, and they feared her more than the male members of the family. Everyone called her Mumu. She contributed the most work and merit in building the family’s fortune.” The Water Witch's tomb can be seen in the left-side parcel of the Reformed Cemetery in Magyarrégen.
