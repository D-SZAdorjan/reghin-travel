The DIO House is a building serving educational, cultural, and religious functions for the Hungarian community of Szászrégen. The facility was designed by the famous architect Imre Makovecz, while the execution was carried out by architect-engineer Dr. Csaba Müller. The construction took place between 1996 and 2002. One of the unique features of the DIO House is that among its more than 40 doors and windows, no two are identical in size or shape. The building has a very distinctive style: its roof structure is convex on one side and concave on the other. There is no room in the building that is simply square, rectangular, or circular—each space takes on a different shape, always stretching, narrowing, or widening in some direction.

The building is owned by the church, which is also reflected in its name. "DIO" refers to the building’s spiritual essence, as the word can be identified with God in Latin and Spanish. Each letter of the name DIO represents a different role fulfilled by the House. The letter "D" stands for social service, the letter "I" represents youth, indicating the building’s dedication to young people. The letter "O" stands for education, encompassing the many lectures, cultural and religious events, and educational programs held there. The House also includes a guesthouse with a capacity of 24 people, and the income generated from this helps with the regular maintenance of the building.
