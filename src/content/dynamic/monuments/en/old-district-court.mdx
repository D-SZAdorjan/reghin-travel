One of the most impressive buildings in the main square houses the Alexandru Ceuşianu General School. The building was likely erected in the 1870s in a neoclassical style and originally served as the seat of the Royal Hungarian District Court. After the communist takeover, the building remained under the ownership of the Ministry of Justice. In 1948, the Hungarian Teacher Training Institute from Târgu Mureș was relocated to Szászrégen, initially—due to political reasons—to the Saxon school next to the Evangelical Church. In 1949, the Institute managed to rent the District Court building along with its adjoining prison facilities, remaining there until 1956. Notable figures such as András Kovács and Lajos Demény, external members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, studied in this school.

In addition to its beautiful neoclassical features, the school building is also famous for a fresco. Inside, one can find a mural depicting Justitia, the Roman goddess personifying justice, blindfolded, holding a sword in one hand and scales in the other—an echo of the building's former function as a District Court. The building holds another surprise: during the most recent renovation, portraits of the Árpád dynasty kings were uncovered on the capitals of the entrance hall columns. Unfortunately, after the renovation was completed, they were once again covered with lime.

The city still has many valuable old school buildings that faithfully reflect its former architectural richness. Among them is the current Augustin Maior School—an imposing, two-story neoclassical building located on Școlii Street, built by the Saxons in 1894. This building housed German-language education until 1944.
