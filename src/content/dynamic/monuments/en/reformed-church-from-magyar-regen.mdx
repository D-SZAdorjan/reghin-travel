    Reformed Church of Magyar-Régen

Among the city’s non-monument churches, the Reformed Church of Magyar-Régen is the older. It was built on the site of a former Roman castrum. A legend suggests that the original medieval church was constructed during the era of the Goths; more likely, it was built in the Gothic style, although no traces remain today due to successive renovations. The church, initially built during the Árpád era, was destroyed in the fires of 1848. Its reconstruction was completed in 1854, during which the medieval tower was demolished. Between 1910 and 1911, the building underwent extensive reconstruction and expansion, including the construction of the current tower. Historical records confirm that the original church had a single nave and a straight-ended sanctuary.

Evidence of the church’s Árpád-era origin was discovered during renovations in 1939, when parts of the original walls were unearthed—composed of two-thirds lime and one-third gravel. On the partially preserved plaster of the original southern wall, a painted consecration cross from the same period was found, which remains visible today. Based on these findings, the then-pastor concluded that the church was built during the same period as the churches in Marosfelfalu and Körtvélyfája, all consecrated by a bishop during the Árpád era.
