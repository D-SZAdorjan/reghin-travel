    Roman Catholic Church

The church for the city's Roman Catholic community was only built in 1736, commissioned by Queen Maria Theresa. According to the official seal, construction of the church began in 1736 but was only completed in 1781 due to a lack of funds. The church has a single nave, is rectangular in shape, and was built in late Baroque style. The interior walls of the church are decorated with carefully crafted frescoes. The frescoes on the vault, depicting the petitions of the Lord's Prayer, were painted in 1968. The main altar was built in neo-Baroque style and features an image of the Immaculate Conception, with a statue of Saint Paul to the right and Saint Peter to the left.

Noteworthy are the colorful stained glass windows reflecting the uniqueness of the church, which depict prominent figures, kings, and saints of our nation. Another interesting feature is the church garden, which has been turned into a sculpture park. The first statue represents Áron Márton, the great bishop of Transylvania; it is worth noting that this was the first full-figure outdoor statue erected in his honor. In the sculpture park, one can also find a bust of Sándor Petőfi, as well as statues of Queen Blessed Gisela and Saint Stephen, inaugurated in 2000. In 2003, a bust of Prince Ferenc II Rákóczi and his loyal servant Kelemen Mikes was added. At one time, a bust of Albert Wass also stood here, but today only the empty pedestal remains, as the state removed it in 2003, citing him as a war criminal. Nowadays, the sculpture park serves as the venue for March 15th commemorations.
