Another promising attraction in the town center is the Coat of Arms Fountain located at the end of Salt Street (Só utca), which showcases three different coats of arms from various periods in Szászrégen's history. On the left side of the fountain, we can spot what is presumed to be the city’s first coat of arms from 1428. It features a round-bottomed shield divided by a diagonal band. In the upper left heraldic corner, there is a six-pointed star, while in the lower right heraldic corner, we can see an Anjou lily. On the diagonal band, the inscription "O.P.R." is visible, which likely stands for *Oppidum Privilegiatum Regun*, referring to the city’s privileged market town status.

This coat of arms can also be found above the sacristy door of the Evangelical Church. In the middle of the fountain, we see a simplified version of the city’s 1848 coat of arms, which likely depicts a medieval herald or messenger. The coat of arms on the right side dates back to 1934 and features a shield showing a raftman wearing a hat, while the waves likely represent the waters of the Mureș River. In the early 20th century, rafting on the Mureș was widespread in the town, which likely explains the presence of this symbol. The coat of arms is crowned with three bastions.

There are some disagreements regarding the 15th-century coat of arms. According to historian Imre Schmidt—who was also the mayor of the town between 1940 and 1944—the city never actually used this coat of arms. He argued that the round-bottomed shield only began to be used during the Renaissance, and therefore could not originate from an earlier time. Additionally, it is uncertain whether the letters on the diagonal band are contemporary with the coat of arms itself, as heraldic tastes of the time favored plain bands. The use of letters on such bands only became fashionable in the second half of the 17th century.
